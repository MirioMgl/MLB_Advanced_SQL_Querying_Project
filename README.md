# MLB_Advanced_SQL_Querying_Project
My first project using advanced MySQL querying techniques and functions


### Introduction

From Maven Analytics Advanced SQL Querying course: 

>Youâ€™ve just been hired as a Data Analyst Intern for Major League Baseball (MLB), who has recently gotten access to a large amount of historical player data
>You have access to decades worth of data, including player statistics like schools attended, salaries, teams played for, height and weight, and more
>Your task is to use advanced SQL querying techniques to track how player statistics have changed over time and across different teams in the league

The dataset comes from **Sean Lahman's Baseball Database** and is divided into four tables:
1. **schools:** *playerID, schoolID, yearID.*
2. **school_details:** *schoolID, name_full, city, state, country.*
3. **players:**
   - *birthYear, birthMonth, birthDay, birthCountry, birthState, birthCity,*
   - *deathYear, deathMonth, deathDay, deathCountry, deathState, deathCity,*
   - *nameFirst, nameLast, nameGiven,*
   - *weight(lb), height(in), bats(R/L/B), throws, debut, finalGame, retroID, bbrefID*
5. **salaries:**
   - *yearID, teamID, lgID, playerID, salary*

### Key Findings

1. The top five schools that produced the most players

The top three schools that produced over one hundred players are particularly impressive. University of Texas at Austin(winning percentage: .600), University of Southern California(wp: .627), Arizona State University(wp: .664). It will be interesting to understand how these three universities managed to create so many players. 

2. The top 3 schools per decade that produced the most players

A lot of the school's names in this chart appears also in the previous chart, meaning that they consistently produced MLB players over the decades. 

3. Top 20% of teams in terms of average annual spending
